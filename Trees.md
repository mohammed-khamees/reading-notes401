# Trees

tree represents the nodes connected by edges. We will discuss binary tree or binary search tree specifically.

Binary Tree is a special datastructure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.

Why Tree Data Structure?
Other data structures such as arrays, linked list, stack, and queue are linear data structures that store data sequentially. In order to perform any operation in a linear data structure, the time complexity increases with the increase in the data size. But, it is not acceptable in today's computational world.

Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure.

## Tree Terminologies

**Node**
A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes.
The last nodes of each path are called leaf nodes or external nodes that do not contain a link/pointer to child nodes.
The node having at least a child node is called an internal node.

**Edge**
It is the link between any two nodes.

**Root**
It is the topmost node of a tree.

**Height of a Node**
The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf (ie. the longest path from the node to a leaf node).

**Depth of a Node**
The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.

**Height of a Tree**
The height of a Tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.

**Degree of a Node**
The degree of a node is the total number of branches of that node.

**Forest**
A collection of disjoint trees is called a forest.
