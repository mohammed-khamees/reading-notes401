# AWS: Cloud Servers

1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

   FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers.

2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

   we have the URLs (nouns) and the HTTP methods (actions) our API responds to. Each combination of URL and HTTP method corresponds to a functionality available

3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

   Most modern programming-languages comprise built-in "event" constructs implementing the observer-pattern components.

4. How do you test an event driven system?

   There are multiple levels of tests you will typically write for your system. In the most canonical case, you will write unit tests, service tests, and end-to-end tests. In each of these cases, your System Under Test (SUT, what is actually being tested) comprises a different part of your application.

## Term:

- Server

  computer that provides data to other computers. It may serve data to systems on a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) over the Internet. Many types of servers exist, including web servers, mail servers, and file servers. Each type runs software specific to the purpose of the server.

- Pub/Sub

  The Publish/Subscribe pattern, also known as pub/sub, is an architectural design pattern that provides a framework for exchanging messages between publishers and subscribers. This pattern involves the publisher and the subscriber relying on a message broker that relays messages from the publisher to the subscribers. The host (publisher) publishes messages (events) to a channel that subscribers can then sign up to.

- WRRC

  The web is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers.

### AWS EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.

**Amazon EC2 provides the following features:**

- Virtual computing environments, known as instances

- Preconfigured templates for your instances, known as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), that package the bits you need for your server (including the operating system and additional software)

- Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for your instances, known as instance types

- Secure login information for your instances using key pairs (AWS stores the public key, and you store the private key in a secure place)

- Storage volumes for temporary data that's deleted when you stop, hibernate, or terminate your instance, known as instance store volumes

- Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), known as Amazon EBS volumes

- Multiple physical locations for your resources, such as instances and Amazon EBS volumes, known as Regions and Availability Zones

- A firewall that enables you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances using security groups

- Static IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing, known as Elastic IP addresses

- Metadata, known as tags, that you can create and assign to your Amazon EC2 resources

- Virtual networks you can create that are logically isolated from the rest of the AWS Cloud, and that you can optionally connect to your own network, known as virtual private clouds (VPCs)

**AWS Elastic Beanstalk** is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. At the same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application and can access the underlying resources at any time.

There is no additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk - you pay only for the AWS resources needed to store and run your applications.s
